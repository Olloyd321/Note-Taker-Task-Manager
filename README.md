## Description 

This repo was created to for my Note Taker & Task Manager app
The video walkthrough can be found at https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119633009/225796355-aa644d75-ffdf-4036-8365-19e16ed54245.mp4

 *NOTES FOR SUBMISSION*
 I still have not recieved my student dev pack for heroku (even after multiple attempts to chase down an answer), 
 I would have to pay out of pocket for heroku deployment, so I don't believe I should have points deducted if heroku deployment is a requirement. 
 This challenge was the most challenging assignment of this course and therefor I had trouble completing all of the criteria.
 This submission does not in any way represent a final product.
 This will not be the only submission for this project.
